# deep-learning-challenge

Background
The nonprofit foundation Alphabet Soup wants a tool that can help it select the applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their ventures. With your knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, youâ€™ll use the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

Requirements
-Preprocess the Data (30 points)
-Create a dataframe containing the charity_data.csv data , and identify the target and feature variables in the dataset (2 points)
-Drop the EIN and NAME columns (2 points)
-Determine the number of unique values in each column (2 points)
-For columns with more than 10 unique values, determine the number of data points for each unique value (4 points)
-Create a new value called Other that contains rare categorical variables (5 points)
-Create a feature array, X, and a target array, y by using the preprocessed data (5 points)
-Split the preprocessed data into training and testing datasets (5 points)
-Scale the data by using a StandardScaler that has been fitted to the training data (5 points)
-Compile, Train and Evaluate the Model (20 points)
-Create a neural network model with a defined number of input features and nodes for each layer (4 points)
-Create hidden layers and an output layer with appropriate activation functions (4 points)
-Check the structure of the model (2 points)
-Compile and train the model (4 points)
-Evaluate the model using the test data to determine the loss and accuracy (4 points)
-Export your results to an HDF5 file named AlphabetSoupCharity.h5 (2 points)
-Optimize the Model (20 points)
-Repeat the preprocessing steps in a new Jupyter notebook (4 points)
-Create a new neural network model, implementing at least 3 model optimization methods (15 points)
-Save and export your results to an HDF5 file named AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimization.h5 (1 point)
-Write a Report on the Neural Network Model (30 points)
-Write an analysis that includes a title and multiple sections, labeled with headers and subheaders (4 points)
-Format images in the report so that they display correction (2)
-Explain the purpose of the analysis (4)
-Answer all 6 questions in the results section (10)
-Summarize the overall results of your model (4)
-Describe how you could use a different model to solve the same problem, and explain why you would use that model (6)
